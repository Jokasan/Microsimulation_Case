The aim is to profile consumers holidaying to city locations in the United States. In the introduction the scope is set out, along with a disclaimer of the underlying assumptions of microsimulated data. In Chapter 2 Data and Methods, an overview of the data is provided, the underlying assumptions of the microsimulated data are explored, and finally the data are inspected given the scope of the report. The following chapter, presents the results and profiles the holidaymaker according to a set of variables, such as age, income, etc. In addition, the geographic distribution of the target market is presented. Finally, chapter 4 concludes the report, providing some ideas as to how the findings might underpin a targeted marketing campaign and future directions are suggested. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Lovelace and Dumont, define spatial microsimulation along two predominant paradigms, as a technique or an approach (Lovelace and Dumont 2018). The former being a method through which spatial microdata is generated, that is, individual level data are allocated to geographical zones. This can be achieved by the combination of individual and geographically aggregated data. In this respect, spatial microsimulation can be thought of as population synthesis (Axhausen, Kay, and Müller 2011). In contrast, microsimulation from an approach point of view, refers to understanding phenomena based on spatial microdata, particularly multi-level phenomena. Due to the creation of synthetic data, microsimulation can be an adequate solution when data availability is limited. Spatial microsimulation seeks to merge the advantages of individual level data with the geographical specificity of geographical data. Although it may seem like microsimulation achieves the best of both worlds of individual and geographical data, there are some key assumptions that underpin spatial microsimulation models and should therefore be considered when thinking about adopting microsimulation (Lovelace, Dimittris, and Watson 2014 ; Lovelace and Dumont 2018). The first assumption refers to the extent to which the microdata is representative of the area being studied. Another assumption that spatial microsimulation makes, is the relationship and interactions between the target variable and its dependency on the constraint variable. In particular, it assumes that the interactions do not fluctuate across space and time. Furthermore, another key assumption is that there is no spatial dependency of the relationship between the constraint variables. Finally, the fourth assumption is that the constraints and micro/individual level data contain an adequate level of detail, such that they can reproduce the diversity of individuals in the study area. This report engages with microsimulation as a technique, to allocate individual level data to geographical zones. In specific, using microsimulation to estimate a population-level dataset of holiday-making behaviours at the household level in Leeds. The individual-level dataset is of a survey describing holiday making behaviours of individuals. In contrast, the constraints data are from the 2011 Census and represent the output area classification in Leeds. These data are then used and applied using microsimulation to obtain a population- level dataset of holiday making behaviours at the household level in Leeds. The scope of this report is to focus on destinations classified as city holidays, specifically city destinations in the United States. The aim is to profile consumers holidaying to these destinations, in order to underpin a targeted marketing campaign. The report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 will explore the data and methods used, taking into account the scope of the study. Chapter 3 will focus on profiling the target market. Finally, Chapter 4 will conclude, synthesising over the findings and establishing the customers to be targeted with a marketing campaign. References "],["data-and-methods.html", "Chapter 3 Data and Methods", " Chapter 3 Data and Methods The microsimulated data contains, 19 variables, 1 of which was determined after generating the microsimulated data (Holiday_type). This is not explicitly defined in the microsimulated data, therefore there are some assumptions that were made to classify the Holiday destinations as either a city or beach, for instance, geographical proximity of the destination airport city to a beach, in this case geographical proximity was considered a proxy for holiday type. As such, out of the 75 unique holiday destinations, 61 are beach holidays and 14 are city holidays. Person_id is a variable describing the unique id of each person in the study area. Zone is a geographical variable that contains the output are classification in Leeds. Oac_group describes the output area classification groups that a person belongs to, the classifications are: “Urbanites,” “Suburbanites,” “Rural Residents,” “Multicultural Metropolitans,” “Hard-pressed Living,” “Ethnicity Central,” “Cosmopolitans” and “Constrained City Dwellers,” but as a factor containing 8 levels each corresponding to a supergroup. The Sex variables describes the sex of the individual, it is either “f” for female or “m” for male. Age_band refers to the age bracket that the individual belongs to, it ranges from “a24under” to “a65over.” Number_children refers to the number of children that the individual has, it ranges from 0 to 4. Household_income refers to the household income of each household, it ranges from “0-10K,” to “81K Plus,” and includes a “Not Answered” category. Overseas_airport refers to the name of the overseas airport the holidaymaker is traveling to. UK_airport refers to the name of the UK airport the holidaymaker is traveling from. Satisfaction_overall, refers to how satisfied the holidaymaker was with their most recent holiday, it ranges from “1_poor” to “4_excellent.” Age_sex refers to a combination of the Sex and Age_band variables, so for instance a female aged between 24-34 would be: “fa24to34,” in contrast a male in the same age bracket would be: “ma24to34.” Similar to Oac_group, the Supergroup_name contains the output area classification group names, however not as factors, but rather, as characters. Dest_airport_name refers to the name of the airport the holidaymakers is traveling to. Dest_airport_city refers to the name of the city the destination airport is in. Dest_airport_country refers to the name of the country the holidaymaker is traveling to. Orig_airport_name refers to the name of the airport the holidaymaker is traveling from. Orig_airport_city refers to the name of the city the origin airport is in. Finally, Holiday_type refers to the type of holiday, classified as either “Beach” or “City” holiday. This is summarised below: Variable Detail Person_id Unique id of respondentaccross the study area. Zone The output area classification zone in Leeds. Oac_grp Description of the super group the output area belongs to. Sex Sex of the respondent Age_band Age band the respondent belongs to. Number_children The number of children the respondent has Household_income The household income of each respndent Overseas_airport The name of the overseas airport. UK_airport Name of the airport in the UK. Satisafaction_overall Level of satisfaction with most recent holiday. Age_sex A combination of the sex and age band variables. Supergroup_name The name of the supergroup the respondent belongs to. Dest_airport_name The name of the destination airport. Dest_airport_city The name of the city the destination airport is in. Dest_airport_country The name of the country the destination airport is in. Orig_airport_name The name of the origin airport. Orig_airport_city The name of the city the origin airport is in. Holiday_type The name of the city the origin airport is in in. To get a sense of the nature of the data, the first few entries are shown below: ## # A tibble: 6 x 19 ## person_id zone oac_grp sex age_band number_children household_income ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 56 E00056750 8 m a65over 0 Not Answered ## 2 63 E00056750 8 f a25to34 2 26-30K ## 3 261 E00056750 8 m a25to34 0 26-30K ## 4 306 E00056750 8 m a65over 0 Not Answered ## 5 326 E00056750 8 m a50to64 0 Not Answered ## 6 348 E00056750 8 m a25to34 2 Not Answered ## # … with 12 more variables: overseas_airport &lt;chr&gt;, uk_airport &lt;chr&gt;, ## # satisfaction_overall &lt;chr&gt;, age_sex &lt;fct&gt;, supergroup_name &lt;chr&gt;, ## # dest_airport_name &lt;chr&gt;, dest_airport_city &lt;chr&gt;, ## # dest_airport_country &lt;chr&gt;, orig_airport_name &lt;chr&gt;, ## # orig_airport_city &lt;chr&gt;, orig_airport_country &lt;chr&gt;, Holiday_type &lt;chr&gt; One of the key assumptions made when generating the microsimulated data, was that the data is fully representative, however is this really the case? It is natural that certain output areas in Leeds will be better represented by the individual-level survey, in comparison to others. The figure below demonstrates the model uncertainty, the extent to which oversampling has occurred. Oversampling in this context refers to cases in which the same respondent has been reassigned to the same Output area several times. The figure below demonstrates the distribution of the Output Areas that are not as well represented by the individual-level survey data. Figure 3.1: Simulation Oversampling By grouping the weights used to generate the microsimulated data, the extent of oversampling can be visualised. There seems to be a higher concentration of oversampling, particularly near the city region and its immediate periphery, as evident by the darker shades of blue in the choropleth map. Similarly given the scope of the report, it would be useful to breakdown the top locations by holiday type. The figure below shows the top destinations by holiday type. Figure 3.2: Top Destinations by Holiday Type It seems that the top destinations for beach holidays are Spain, Greece and Egypt. In contrast, and perhaps more importantly given the scope of this report, the top destinations for city holidays are Turkey, Tunisia, and The United States. As outlined in the introduction, we are interested in the city holidays in the United States, which in this case are Orlando, Florida (MCO &amp; SFB) and Las Vegas, Nevada (LAS). Now that we have a clearer idea of our destinations in the United States, we can profile the holidaymakers traveling to these locations. This is discussed in the next section. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results", " Chapter 4 Results Now that we have the list of city destinations, it would be useful to profile the known population holidaying to these destinations. A useful comparison would be to compare the customer population holidaying to these locations with the Leeds holiday making population as a whole. The figure 3 demonstrates the extent to which the holiday makers to the destinations of interest differ from the Leeds holiday-making population, particularly in terms of 5 demographic variables, age band, household income, number of children, overall satisfaction and supergroup name. From the figure below3, a consumer profile of holidaymakers to American cities starts to emerge. Consumers traveling to these locations are aged between 35 to 49, have a household income of between 41-50 thousand, have children, there seems to be a concentration of consumers with 2 children, were poorly satisfied with their most recent holiday and belong to the Suburbanites super group. From this it can be inferred that the consumers holidaying to these locations are young professionals, living in suburban areas, have a comfortable income, and have at least one child. Figure 4.1: Difference in Proportion of Characteristics off Holidaymakers to Orlando and Las Vegas Expanding upon these findings, it is possible to map the geographical distribution of holidaymakers with the distinguishing characteristics, in this case in the age band 35 to 49, have at least one child, are suburbanites, and were poorly satisfied with their most recent holiday. Unsurprisingly, given that the holidaymakers traveling to the destinations of interest are distinctively suburbanites, the figure below shows that they are located towards the peripheries of the study area or in areas that can be considered more suburban. In fact, upon closer inspection, it seems that there are no/close to zero holidaymakers in the city centre and its immediate periphery traveling to the locations of interest. Figure 4.2: Geographical Distribution of Target Market "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 Future directions", " Chapter 5 Conclusion This report is based on data that was generated using microsimulation, to develop a population-level dataset of holidaymaking behaviours at the household level in Leeds. Some of the underlying assumptions of this method were disclaimed in the introduction, such as the extent of representativeness of the survey/individual level data to the population as a whole. In the following section, data and methods, the data was described and the degree of oversampling as a result of the underlying assumptions was explored. Particularly, the microsimulation oversampling seems to occur in the output areas in the city centre area and its immediate surroundings. Similarly in this section the different destinations according to holiday type were demonstrated, to show where the locations of interest (Orlando &amp; Las Vegas) were ranked relative to other city locations. Once the target locations were identified, in the results section, a unique consumer profile was developed, along 5 main demographic variables/characteristics: age band, household income, number of children, and satisfaction with most recent holiday and Supergroup name. Furthermore, age band, overall satisfaction, suburbanites, and have children, were identified as the characteristics of interest in terms of the geographic distribution of individuals having all these attributes. As figure 4.2 demonstrates these individuals are towards the peripheries of the study area, a key aspect to consider when deciding the spatial element of a targeted marketing strategy. A key assumption made here is the variables of interest, in other words, figure 4.2 only shows individuals that meet all the specified criteria in relation to the specified variables, however it may be the case that the marketing efforts want to be concentrated on individuals having only a subset of the specified variables, for example: suburbanites and children. However, the developed results were generated with specificity in mind, i.e. the more specific the demographics of the target market the better the foundation from which the targeted marketing strategy could be developed. Nevertheless, although the combination of demographics was defined in this case, a separate combination of variables can be developed upon upper management’s request, thereby altering the geographical distribution of the target market. All in all, the target market can be defined as young professionals aged between 35 to 49, with children, enjoy a relatively high income (41-50K), and prefer beach holiday/were not satisfied with their most recent city holiday. Given this information, a suitable marketing strategy would be to market beach holidays as opposed to city holidays to this demographic (given their lack of satisfaction). 5.1 Future directions This report lays the foundation for future exploration into city destinations. In specific, future analysis may focus on aggregating the category, for instance, developing a consumer profile of the individuals holidaying to all city estimations and comparing them to the population as a whole. With regards to the extent to which the microsimulation data oversampled, if the resources were allocable the simulation could be rerun, using other constraint variables to generate the data, in this case the constraints were oac_group and age_sex. The results can then be compared to see how this influences the extent of oversampling. Furthermore, different weighting strategies for developing the microsimulated data can be tested, establishing which algorithms are most efficient for spatial microsimulation.
